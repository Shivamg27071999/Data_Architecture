1. **Top 5 cities by credit card spending** and their percentage contribution to total spend.  
2. **Highest spend month** for each card type.  
3. **Transaction when cumulative spend crosses ₹ 10,00,000** for each card type (first crossing).  
4. **City with the lowest total spend** for the “Gold” card type.
